# PDF Application Experiments

("CalFresh and So Clean")

## Setup

The script is a proof of concept, and has a few dependencies:

- Ruby
- The `pdf-forms` gem ( https://github.com/jkraemer/pdf-forms )
- `pdftk` utility (on Debian-like systems, install via `apt-get install pdftk`)

The script is being developed on Ubuntu 14, and so might need to be modified for other environments.
