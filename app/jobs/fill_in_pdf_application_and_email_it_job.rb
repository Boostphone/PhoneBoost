Hi there!

An application for Calfresh benefits was just submitted!

You can find a completed CF-285 in the attached .zip file. You will probably receive another e-mail shortly containing photos of their verification documents.

The .zip file attached is encrypted because it contains sensitive personal information. If you don't have a password to access it, please get in touch with Jake Solomon at jacob@codeforamerica.org

When you finish clearing the case, please help us track the case by filling out a bit of info here: http://c4a.me/cleancases

Thanks for your time!

Suzanne, your friendly neighborhood CalFresh robot
